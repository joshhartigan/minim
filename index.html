    <p><b>Minim</b> is a scripting language being designed incrementally. It
    follows ruling of Lisp- and C-Style syntax.</p>

    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>The first version of Minim will serve a simple purpose of basic command
    line applications with support for intermediate math and I/O.</p>
    <p>Minim isn't being created to fill a gap in popular programming languages
    or scripting languages, it is only being designed as a practice project, and
    will therefore not have any unique or specific features.</p>
    <p><b>Incremental Design</b> simply means that the design and implementation
    of Minim is being done in parts. Each part will be documented in the code
    repository and on this website.</p>

    <div id="part">
      <h3>Part 1: Function Calls</h3>
      <p>I'm not sure whether or not this is an odd thing to implement first, but I'm doing it anyway. I want functions to be called with a lisp style (although this language is not going to be a lisp derivative), and I want to start out with basic standard-library-esque functions.</p>
      <p>Functions are called as such: <code>(name arg1 arg2 ar...)</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="part">
      <h3>Part 2: Variable Definition</h3>
      <p>An obvious feature for most imperative languages. Variables are defined like this: <code>var name = value</code>, and can be accessed simply by their identifier as a bare word.</p>
