# Minim

I want to make a scripting language, and I want to also improve my general
ability in programming. This project is going to (hopefully) allow me to both of
these things. I am going to slowly write an implementation of my own language,
whic may or may not turn out to be useful for people. The development will be
done in incremental parts.
